# 🌹 Rose Day – Digital Valentine Surprise

A minimal, romantic interactive web experience built for Valentine Week.  
This project starts with a blooming rose and ends with a heart — responding to user taps with animation, music, petals, glow, and playful messages.

Built to feel **personal, emotional, and intentional** — not flashy, not cringe.
